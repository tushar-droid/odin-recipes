    <h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
    <img src= '../images/grilled_cheese.webp'/>
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Everyone needs to know how to make a classic grilled cheese sandwich. Whether you're a beginner cook or an old pro, you'll come back to this top-rated grilled cheese recipe again and again.</p>
        <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
        </ol>
